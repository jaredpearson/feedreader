# Mechanisms and Users
#---------------------------------
#
# This default qpidd configuration allows for only SASL ANONYMOUS authentication. 
# To additionally enable DIGEST-MD5 authentication:
#
# 1. edit the mech_list below to read   
#      mech_list: DIGEST-MD5 ANONYMOUS
#
# 2. To add new a new user+password to the sasldb file:
#      echo $PASSWD | saslpasswd2 -c -p -f $SASLTEST_DB -u QPID $USERNAME
#
#
#                              PLEASE NOTE 
#  For production messaging systems, a high-security mechanism such as
#  DIGEST-MD5 or PLAIN+SSL should be enabled.

# Other Notes
#---------------------------------
#
# 1. If you use a nonstandard location for your sasl_config directory,
#    you can point qpidd to it by using the --sasl-config option.
#    If your nonstandard sasl directory is $MY_SASL_DIR, put a copy
#    of this file at $MY_SASL_DIR/qpidd.conf, alter the mech list as 
#    appropriate for your installation, and then use the saslpasswd2 
#    command to add new user+passwd pairs:
#      echo $PASSWD | saslpasswd2 -c -p -f $MY_SASL_DIR/qpidd.sasldb -u QPID $USERNAME
#    
#
# 2. The standard location for the qpidd sasldb file is 
#       /var/lib/qpidd/qpidd.sasldb
#
# 3. You can see what usernames have been stored in the sasldb, with the
#    sasldblistusers2 command.
#
# 4. The REALM is important and should be the same as the --realm
#    option to the broker. This lets the broker properly find the user in
#    the sasldb file.
#
# 5. The sasldb file must be readable by the user running the qpidd
#    daemon, and should be readable only by that user.
